## About StreetShield

Too often, folks on the street and in the shelter system experience harassment, discrimination, and violence at the hands of those in power--police, government agencies, and shelter administration. Too often, the only avenues for accountability involve the very agencies perpetuating the abuse.   
  
Grassroots groups, led by currently and formerly homeless people, have long organized for justice and worked to hold politicians and powerful agencies accountable.   
  
StreetShield is a tool to help these grassroots groups collect _anonymous_ data to further campaigns that create accountability for the shelter-industrial complex and housing justice for all homeless, houseless, and marginalized people.
