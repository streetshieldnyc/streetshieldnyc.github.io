## How it works:

StreetShield uses an automated text message call service called RapidPro. When someone texts or calls the StreetShield number, the RapidPro software begins a series of questions that the person texting responds to, creating an anonymous data point describing the incident that they are reporting.  
The anonymous data is then sorted based on geography, such as by city and stored securely on a server. Each grassroots group has their own unique login; when they access StreetShield, they are able to see all of the anonymized data related to their text and phone surveys.
